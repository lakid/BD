"Oudini" was the man on the spot, for with a few twists and a few more turns, he loosed his wrists from their bonds and received the plaudits of an appreciative audience.</p><p>To-night an act which no one but a dead man has ever attempted will hold the boards, for "Oudini" will escape from a <a href="The-Coffin.html">coffin</a>, and those who have not seen him should not miss this opportunity. Challenges are coming in thick and fast, some of them being: From C. W. Foster to get out of a piano box, also challenges from the five and ten-cent store, Simonds & Adams, and from the shippers in Winchell's.—Haverhill Gazette, Feb. 13, 1908.</p><p>"Oudini the Uusurpassed." But there is no phrase which exactly tells how this wonderful man from Boston does his amazing tricks in such a short space of time in escaping from jail, from handcuffs, from <a href="The-Packing-Case.html">packing cases</a>, from trunks, and from all kinds of seemingly impossible barriers. "Oudini" has mystified hundreds at the New Orpheum this week, and of all who have had the pleasure of beholding him at his work, none have been able to fathom the alacrity with which he breaks away from the ties.</p><p>Last night the main act was escaping from a boiler which had been securely bolted, riveted, and declared utterly impassable by the hundreds in the audience. The young man entered the boiler with a smiling face, but those who saw him considered it impossible for him to get out alive. No such unhappy end was in waiting for the wizard, however, for it was not long before he stepped to the footlights, tired, looking somewhat fatigued, but with the proud knowledge that he had conquered.</p><p>Henry Lemieux, a local man, had a pair of handcuffs which he declared no man could get out of. The crafty "Oudini" was the man on the spot, for with a few twists and a few more turns he loosed his wrists from the bonds and received the plaudits of an appreciative audience.</p><p>To-night, an act which no one but a dead man has ever attempted will hold the boards, for "Oudini" will endeavor to escape from a coffin, and those who have not seen this wonderful man should not miss the opportunity this evening. Challenges are coming in thick and fast, some of them being: From C. W. Foster to get out of a piano box, also challenges from the five and ten-cent store, Simonds & Adams, and from the shippers at J. H. WincheWs.—Haverhill Record, Feb. 13, 1908.</p><p>Accepting the challenge issued by "Oudini," who' is performing at the Orpheum the shipping clerks at J. H. Winchell & Co's. shoe factory say they will furnish that gentleman with a box next Tuesday evening and will bring it to the theatre at any hour the management may decide upon. The only condition that the clerks make in accepting the challenge is that no one handle the box up to the minute that "Oudini" steps into it. This they consider a reasonable request and they await an acceptance.—Haverhill Gazette, Feb. 15, 1908.</p><p>There is great popularity and applause greeting "Oudini," the mystifier, who is appearing at the Orpheum this week. Last night, before one of the largest crowds of the week, the handcuff king escaped from a wooden packing case, six by four feet, after it had been securely nailed and fastened. Everyone was astonished at the great act, which he challenged anyone to duplicate. Tonight the novel feat of getting out of a paper box will be attempted by the wizard.—Haverhill Gazette.</p><p>"He is certainly a wonder." This was the phrase that was heard on all sides last evening at the New Orpheum of those who were able to gain admittance to the theatre to see "Oudini." The news that he was to perform in this city spread like wildfire, and so great was the crowd that it was impossible for all to gain admittance, and many had to retreat and will no doubt be at the theatre this evening to see him. He did all kinds of tricks yesterday, and one of the first was getting out of Patrolman Sullivan's handcuffs. These were placed on him by Patrolman Ryan of the night force, and, although he had a hard time, he was out of them in exactly nine minutes. Last evening he got in some of his finest work. He was handcuffed, chained and shackled by Officer Kelly, and after four minutes' time he was out of them, to the surprise of the crowd. Tonight he is due to get out of a United States <a href="The-Mail-Bag.html">mail bag</a>, but, besides being locked in the bag, he will also be shackled and chained by members of the audience. He has a pair of handcuffs which Patrolman Denoncour says he cannot get off, and these, he claims, he will get out of this evening. The patrolman has told many that nobody has ever been able to get out of them, and doubts if he ever will. Another feature already mentioned is that Harry Lemieux has another pair of handcuffs which three handcuff kings have been unsuccessful to get out of, and he says that he knows he will not be able to get out of them. He has accepted the challenge and will take them off Wednesday evning at 8 o'clock, at which time two members of the police force will put them on him.-Haverhill Gazette.</p><p>"Oudini," the handcuff wonder of the age, will appear at Park Square Rink afternoons and evenings during the week. Claiming to be possessed of magnetic gifts that enable him to free himself from all bolts, locks and bars, he challenges any person witnessing his act to lock handcuffs upon him. He has a series of acts arranged for the coming week that cannot but startle the most sceptical. This afternoon and evening he will be placed in a mail pouch, and before being locked in this pouch or bag, he will cause himself to be shackled and handcuffed. In due time he will free himself from the bag and appear unhandcuffed and unshackled. "Oudini" will be locked in an <a href="The-Iron-Boiler.html">iron boiler</a> and also in a coffin, in different performances.—Boston Post.</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="Comments-By-The-Press.html">Comments By The Press</a></li><li><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></li><li>next: <a href="Comments-By-The-Press-Part-3.html">Comments By The Press.
