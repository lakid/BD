Three Methods Of Mental Healing</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>While there are countless methods and processes of manifesting Mental Healing under the general principles of Mental Therapeutics, still these methods may be grouped into three general classes or principles of application. The student who will thoroughly acquaint himself with the underlying principle of each of these three general classes will be master of the entire system, for all methods or forms of application are found to be but some variation of one of these general classes, or else a combination of one or more of them.</p><p>These three general classes of the methods of applying Mental Healing are as follows: (1) Healing by <a href="Lesson-XI-Mental-Suggestion.html">Mental Suggestion</a>; (2) Healing by Present <a href="Lesson-XVI-Thought-Induction.html">Thought Induction</a>; and (3) Healing by Distant Thought Induction.</p><p>The student should always remember, however, that it is a very rare occurrence indeed for any one of the above stated general methods to be employed exclusively. In most cases there is always a greater or less degree of combination or blending of two or more methods.</p><p>This last statement may be verified by analyzing the cases in which some one of the above stated methods is apparently exclusively employed. It will be found that (sometimes almost unconsciously) the principles of one or more of the other methods is blended with that which is specially employed. For instance, the practitioner using the method of Mental Suggestion almost always also uses Personal Thought Induction in the presence of the patient, and often also Distant Thought Induction when thinking of "the case" between treatments. In the same way, the practitioner employing the methods of Direct Thought Induction always invariably uses more or less Mental Suggestion (though he may do so unconsciously) when he is talking to the patient; and he also uses Distant Thought Induction when thinking of "the case" between treatments. And, in the same way, the practitioner employing the methods of Distant Thought Induction almost invariably uses Mental Suggestion when conversing with the patient regarding the arrangements for treatments, or in the correspondence concerning the same, and at the same time employs Personal Thought Induction when in the presence of the patient.</p><p>But, inasmuch as all of these methods proceed to effect cures by means of the same fundamental principle, i. e., that of arousing into renewed and normal activity and functioning the <a href="Lesson-IV-Mind-In-The-Cells.html">mind in the cells</a>, organs and part of the body of the patient, the question of just what particular method, or combination of methods is used, is one of merely academic interest to the practitioner, and is to be subordinated to the question of "just how" to reach the mind of the affected parts.</p><p>The student and practitioner, however, will soon discover that some particular form of treatment is best adapted to the requirements of certain patients, while another form will best suit those of other patients, and so on. By understanding the fundamental sameness underlying the superficial differences in the three methods (and the variation thereof), and by acquainting himself with the best ways of applying each and all of these methods, the practitioner will be equipped to handle effectively any kind of case that presents itself for treatment, and to adapt his treatment to meet the personal idiosyncrasies or peculiarities of each patient.</p><p>The practitioner who allows himself to fall into the error of believing that some one particular method or principle of Mental Healing is the "whole thing," and the only thing, is placed at a disadvantage for obvious reasons. The broad-gauge practitioner is able to apply the principles of Mental Healing in a scientific manner, rather than in the spirit of partisanship, or narrow loyalty to some particular teacher or school. The best practitioner of Mental Therapeutics is he who "takes his own wherever he finds it," and presses it into service in his work-the true "eclectic" who takes what is best in many systems; who wisely selects and boldly employs. There is no place for narrowness and one-sided-ness in Mental Therapeutics, if one wishes to become and remain a successful practitioner thereof.</p><p>While we shall, of course, explain the principles underlying each one of these three general classes of the methods of applying Mental Healing when we come to consider each in its proper place in these lessons, it will be as well for us to consider at this place the fundamental features and characteristics of each in turn, that we may form a clear mental conception of each, and perceive its place in the general system or principle of Mental Therapeutics.</p><h2>Mental Suggestion</h2><p>By Mental Suggestion is not meant hypnotic suggestion, although in the public mind the two usually are regarded as the same. Hypnotic Suggestion is merely Mental Suggestion administered when the patient or subject is in the hypnotic state. As eminent authorities have well stated it, "the hypnotic condition is a state in which Mental Suggestion has an exaggerated effect;" but it should be thoroughly understood that Mental Suggestion does not depend upon the presence of the hypnotic state. The best practitioners of Mental Suggestion today do not seek to induce the hypnotic condition in their patients, and, in fact, in most cases they frown upon the practice of doing so.</p><p>The principle of Mental Suggestion is simply that of placing in the subconscious mind of the patient a firm, strong, positive idea of the physical condition sought to be induced in Mm. Suggestion differs from logical argument or reasoning inasmuch as it does not seek to convince by logical proof, but rather depends upon its acceptance by reason of its strong insistence, and authoritative form of presentation. The principle underlying Suggestion is indicated by the original meaning of the Latin terms from which it was derived, i. e., "suggero," meaning, literally,' "to carry or place under." The technical meaning of "to suggest" is "to indirectly introduce into the mind."</p><p>Hollander cleverly defines Suggestion as: "a process of communication of an idea to the subconscious mind in an unobtrusive manner, carrying conviction; when consciously there is no inclination for its acceptance, and logically there are no adequate grounds for its acceptance. " Bechterew, equally cleverly says:i' Suggestion enters into the understanding by the back stairs, while logical persuasion knocks at the front door."</p><p>Mental Suggestion in Mental Healing conveys to the mind of the patient the idea or mental picture of the physical condition sought to be induced-and it conveys this by words, spoken, written, or printed. The subconscious mind accepting the idea or picture so introduced passes it on to that phase of itself known to us as the <a href="Lesson-II-The-Corporeal-Mind.html">Corporeal Mind</a>, and this in turn passes it on to the organ and cell minds concerned with that portion of the body in which the physical condition is sought to be induced or created.</p><p>This is the one point to be remembered regarding Mental Suggestion, at least at this stage of our lessons, viz.: Mental Suggestion creates the desired idea in the Corporeal Mind by means of words-spoken, written, or printed.</p><h2><a name="personal_thought_induction"></a>Personal Thought Induction</h2><p>By Personal Thought Induction the idea of the physical condition sought to be induced is introduced into the subconscious mind, and thus to the Corporeal Mind, and to the cells and organs governed by the latter-but not by words, spoken, written, or printed, as in the case of Mental Suggestion. There is a broad distinction here which the student should note and remember.</p><p>Personal Thought Induction, however, is always manifested when the practitioner is in the immediate personal presence of the patient -just as in the case of Mental Suggestion by words spoken. The principle involved is one of which we shall of course speak in detail, and in full, at the appropriate time in these lessons. For the present, however, it is sufficient to state that it is a fact known to students of advanced psychology that Thought, like magnetism or electricity, radiates from the thinker, and, coming in contact with the mental aura of the patient, tends to induce there a corresponding idea, thought, or mental picture of the physical condition which is sought to be induced in the patient.</p><p>These thought-vibrations, however, are not consciously perceived by the patient; instead, they are taken up only by his subconscious mind, and then passed on to the Corporeal Mind, and then to the cell and organ minds of his body. Once reaching the subconscious mind, the process is identical with the process manifested in cases of Mental Suggestion as above described. So you see the practical distinction between the two methods of Mental Healing so far considered, viz., Mental Suggestion and Personal Thought Induction, respectively, is simply that of the difference in reaching the subconscious mind of the patient. From that point and stage, the two processes are practically identical.</p><h2><a name="distant_thought_induction"></a>Distant Thought Induction</h2><p>In Distant Thought Induction we have the principle of Thought Induction, just described, plus the manifestation of certain mental powers which serve to carry the thought-vibrations beyond the ordinary limits and range of Thought Induction. In this form of Thought Induction the principle of Jhought Radiation is extended so as to become available even though many miles separate the practitioner from the patient. It accomplishes for Thought Radiation that which the telescope accomplishes for the faculty of sight; or the telephone for the faculties of hearing and speech.</p><p>In Distant Thought Induction the practitioner (a) first creates in himself the mental idea and picture of the physical condition sought to be induced in the patient, just as in the case of Personal Thought Induction; then (b) he puts into operation certain powers of the mind and will (hereafter to be described and explained to the student) which serve to carry his thought vibrations to a distance-to project them upto space, so as to reach the distant patient; lien (c) the vibrations reaching the subconscious mind of the patient are taken up, translated into ideas and pictures corresponding to those in the mind of the practitioner, and then passed on the Corporeal Mind, and thus to the cell-minds and organ-minds.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>So, the student perceives, the underlying principle of each and every one of these methods of manifesting Mental Healing is the same, namely that of reaching the cell-minds, and organ-minds, of the patient, via the subconscious mind and the Corporeal Mind of the patient; and by producing or inducing in these mental planes of the patient the idea and mental picture of the physical conditions sought to be created, produced, or induced in him. This is the great, broad, general, underlying principle of Mental Healing-the rest is but the matter of application, technique, and good judgment in selecting the particular methods best adapted to the particular case. As we proceed, the student should frequently refer to the present lesson, so as to keep fresh and clear in his mind this important fundamental and basic fact of his treatments.</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="Lesson-IX-Disguised-Mental-Healing.html">Lesson IX.
