Continued</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful <a href="Snow-Drop.html">Snow-drop</a> stretched out upon the ground, as if she were quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, " The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away."</p><p>When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said—</p><p>"Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land;</p><p>But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,</p><p>Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,</p><p>There Snow-drop is hiding her head; and she</p><p>Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee."</p><p>Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snow-drop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb. When she reached the dwarfs' cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, "Fine wares to sell! " But Snowdrop said, "I dare not let any one in." Then the queen said, "Only look at my beautiful combs ! " and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. "There you may lie," said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snow-drop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to any one.</p><p>Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before ; and she said, " Snow-drop shall die, if it cost me my life." So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant's wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs' cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snow-drop put her head out of the window and said, " I dare not let any one in, for the dwarfs have told me not." "Do as you please," said the old woman, " but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you." "No," said Snow-drop, "I dare not take it." "You silly girl! " answered the other, "what are you afraid of? do you think it is poisoned ? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other." Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snow-drop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground. "This time nothing will save thee," said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said—</p><p>"Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair."</p><p>And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be.</p><p>When evening came, and the dwarfs had got home, they found Snow-drop lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water ; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy, and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, "We will never bury her in the cold ground." And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a king's daughter. And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snow-drop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.</p><p>And thus Snow-drop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she were asleep ; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs' house; and he saw Snow-drop, and read what was written in golden letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away ; but they said, " We will not part with her for all the gold in the world." At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snow-drop awoke, and said, "Where ami?" And the prince said, "Thou art quite safe with me."</p><p>Then he told her all that had happened, and said, " I love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father's palace, and you shall be my wife. And Snow-drop consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding.</p><p>To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snow-drop's old enemy the queen ; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said—</p><p>"Tell me, glass tell me true!</p><p>Of all the ladies in the land,</p><p>Wo is the fairest? tell me, who?"</p><p>And the glass answered—</p><p>"Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I meen;</p><p>But lovelier far is the new-made queen."</p><p>When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snow-drop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snow-drop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snow-drop in her time of need.</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="Snow-Drop.html">Snow-Drop</a></li><li><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></li><li>next: <a href="The-Four-Crafts-Men.html">The Four Crafts-Men</a></li></ul><h1>Tags</h1><p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=fairy%20tales">fairy tales</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=children's%20stories">children's stories</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=brothers%20grimm">brothers grimm</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=household%20tales">household tales</a></p><!-- SwishCommand noindex --></div><br><!-- content end --><br /><!-- AddThis Button BEGIN --><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_2"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_3"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_4"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a><a class="addthis_counter addthis_bubble_style"></a></div><script type="text/javascript">var addthis_config = {"data_track_addressbar":true};</script><script type="text/javascript" src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-538af58830863a24"></script><!-- AddThis Button END --><br /><div class="hidden-phone"><br /><script type="text/javascript"><!--
