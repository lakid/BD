Part 3</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>Q. Would you mind telling us what was the subject of your brief conversation with the deceased?</p><p>A. I asked her what she was doing there.</p><p>Q. Just so. And she answered, Mr Kennett?</p><p>A. O ! what one might expect.</p><p>Q. Evasively, that is to sav?</p><p>A. Yes.</p><p>Q. Did you twit her, possibly, with being there for an assignation?</p><p>A. Something of the sort I might.</p><p>Q. And she admitted it?</p><p>A. Of course not. (Laughter.)</p><p>Q. What else, would you mind saying?</p><p>A. I understood from her that she had come out to escape the company in the kitchen. It seemed therejiad been a row regarding her between Cleghorn our butler and the prisoner, and she wanted to get away from them both. She said that the foreigner had paid her unwelcome attentions, and had tried to kiss her, for which she had boxed his ears, and that ever since she had gone in fear of her life from him. (Sensation.) I took it more for a joke than a formal complaint, and did not suppose her to be serious. It did not occur to me that she was really frightened of the man, or I should have taken steps for her protection.</p><p>Q. And that was all ?</p><p>A. All that was essential.</p><p>Q. Thank you, Mr Kennett. I will not trouble you any further.</p><p>Witness turned and retired. His evidence had yielded something of the unexpected, in its incredulous little outburst and in its conclusion. As to the first, it was patent that Counsel's object in putting the question which had provoked it was to suggest maddened jealousy as a motive for the crime on the part of some one to whom the girl's actions had become suddenly visible through her movement towards the witness, between whom and herself had possibly occurred some philandering passages</p><p>Such, at least, from the witness's own implied admission of a certain freedom in his conversation with the deceased, would appear a justifiable assumption. His final statement--though legally inadmissible-inasmuch as it supplied the motive with a name, caused a profound stir in Court.</p><p>Mrs Anna Bingley, housekeeper to Sir Calvin Kennett, was the next witness called. Her evidence repeated, in -effect, what has already been recorded, and may be passed over. Where it was important, it was, like the other, evidence of hearsay, and inadmissible.</p><p>Jane Ketchlove, cook to Sir Calvin, gave evidence. She had never seen the prisoner till the night of his arrival, though she had seen his master once or twice on the occasion of former visits. He, the Baron, had not at those times come accompanied by any gentleman. Mr Cabanis made himself quite at home like : he was a very lively, talkative person, and easily excited, she thought. He showed himself very forward with the ladies, and they remarked on it, though putting it down to his foreign breeding. On the night of his arrival the valet went up to lay out his master's things about seven o'clock. Shortly <a href="Chapter-X-Afterwards.html">afterwards</a> Annie followed him with the hot water. She, witness, rather wondered over the girl's assurance in going alone, after the way the man had been acting towards her. He had seemed hke one struck of a heap with her beauty; for the poor creature was beautiful, there was no denying it. It was as if he claimed her for his own from the first moment of his seeing her, and dared any one to say him nay. A few minutes later Annie came down, red with fury over his having tried to kiss her. She had boxed his ears well for him, she said. Mr Cleghorn was in the kitchen, and he flew into a fury when he heard. He said she must have encouraged the man, or he never would have dared. He was a great admirer of Annie himself, and it was always said among us that they would come to make a match of it. Annie answered up, asking him what business it was of his, ,'.and there was a fine row between the two. In the middle this Cabanis came down. His cheek was red as fire, and he looked hke a devil. He said no one had ever struck him- man, woman, or child--without living to repent it. He and Mr Cleghorn got at it then, and the rest of us had a hard ado to part them ; but we got things quiet after a time, though it was only for a time, Mr Cleghorn having to go upstairs, upset as he was. They simmered hke, and came on the boil again the next day at dinner in the servants' hall. Annie was not there, and that seemed to give them the chance to settle things in her absence. Mr Cleghorn began it, insisting on his prior claim to the girl, and Cabanis answered that, if he couldn't, have her, nobody else should; he would see her dead first. That led to a struggle, ending in blows between them; and at the last Cabanis broke away, declaring he was going out then and there to find the girl and put the question to her. Q. What question?</p><p>A. Whether it was to be himself or Mr Cleghorn, sir.</p><p>Q. Did he utter any threat against the girl, in case her choice was against him?</p><p>A. Not in so many words, sir; but we were all terrified by his look and manner.</p><p>Q. They struck you as meaning business, eh?</p><p>A. That was it, sir.</p><p>Q. About what time was that?</p><p>A. As near as possible to two o'clock.</p><p>Q. And Mr Cleghorn followed?</p><p>A. After waiting a bit, sir, to recover himself. Then he got up sudden, saying he was going to see this thing through, and, putting on his cap and coat, out he went.</p><p>Q. At what time was that?</p><p>A. It may have been ten minutes after the other.</p><p>Q. Did you form any conclusion as to what he meant by seeing the thing through?</p><p>A. We all thought he meant, sir, that he was going to follow Cabanis and get the girl herself to choose between them.</p><p>Q. When did you see him again?</p><p>A. It was at half after four, when, as some of us stood waiting and shivering at the head of the path, he came amongst us.</p><p>Q. In his cap and overcoat ?</p><p>A. Yes, sir. Just as he had gone out. We told him what had happened.</p><p>Q And how did he take it?</p><p>A. Very bad, sir. He turned that white, I thought he would have fallen.</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="The-Inquest-Part-2.html">The Inquest.
