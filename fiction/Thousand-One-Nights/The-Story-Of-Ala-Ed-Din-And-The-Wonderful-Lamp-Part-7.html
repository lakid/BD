Part 7</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>When his mother heard her son's story and what the Moorish sorcerer had done to him, she said: "Yea, my son, of a truth he is a miscreant and a hypocrite, a hypocrite who slays folk by his magic; and it was only the grace of God Most High, my son, that delivered thee from the wiles and spells of this accursed, whom I believed to be in truth thine uncle." And 'Ala-ed-Din, since he had not slept a wink for three days, and found himself nodding, sought his repose and went to sleep, and his mother likewise slept afterwards; and he did not wake up till near noon on the second day. As soon as he was awake he wanted something to eat, for he was hungry. And she said to him: "O my son, I have nought to give thee, because thou didst eat yesterday all that there was in the house; but wait awhile; I have spun yarn which I will take to the market and sell and buy thee something to eat with the proceeds." To which 'Ala-ed-Din replied: "Mother, keep thy yarn; sell it not, but give me the Lamp I brought, that I may go sell it, and buy therewith something to eat, for I think the Lamp will fetch more than the yarn." So she arose and brought the Lamp to her son, and she found it very dirty, and said: "O my son, here is the Lamp, but verily it is dirty, and when we have cleaned and polished it it will sell for a greater price." So she went and took a handful of sand, and fell to rubbing the Lamp therewith; but she had hardly begun to rub when there appeared before her one of the Jann, of terrible aspect and vast stature, as it were of the giants. And he said to her: "Tell me what thou dost want of me; here am I, thy slave, and the slave of him who holdeth the Lamp; not I only, but all the slaves of the <a href="Appendix-The-Story-Of-Ala-Ed-Din-And-The-Wonderful-Lamp.html">Wonderful Lamp</a> which is in thy hand." But she trembled, and fear gat hold of her, and her tongue clave as she gazed upon that terrible form; and she could not answer, because she was not accustomed to seeing apparitions like that. So in her terror she could not make any reply to the Marid, but fell down overcome with alarm. But 'Ala-ed-Din her son was waiting hard by, and had seen the 'Efrit of the Ring which he had rubbed when in the Treasury; and hearing the speech of the <a href="Nights-1-3-The-Story-Of-The-Merchant-And-The-Jinni.html">Jinni</a> to his mother, he hastened forward and seized the Lamp from her hand, saying: "O</p><p>Slave of the Lamp, I am hungry; and I wish thee to bring me something to eat, and let it be something good beyond imagination/' So the Jinni vanished for a moment and brought him a magnificent tray of great price, made of pure silver, on which were twelve dishes of various foods and delicious dainties, and two cups of silver and flagons of clear old wine, and bread whiter than snow; and he set them before 'Ala-ed-Din and vanished. And 'Ala-ed-Din arose and sprinkled water on his mother's face and made her smell pungent perfumes, and she revived. Then he said: "O my mother, come and eat of this food which God Most High hath provided for us." And when his mother saw the beautiful table, that it was of silver, she marvelled at this affair, and said: "O my son, who is this generous benefactor that hath satisfied our hunger and lightened our poverty? Verily we are in his debt, and I am thinking that the Sultan, seeing our case and our poverty, sent this tray of food to us himself." "O my mother," he answered, "this is not a time for speculation; come, let us eat, for we arc anhungered/' So they went and sat down to the tray and fell to eating, and 'Ala-ed-Din's mother tasted viands such as never in all her life had she eaten the like thereof. So they ate heartily with the utmost appetite from the violence of their hunger; moreover, the food was fit for Kings. But they knew not if the tray were precious or not, for they had never seen its like in their born days. And when they had done eating (but they left enough for supper and to last for the next day), they arose and washed their hands and sat down to talk, and 'Ala-ed-Din's mother turned to her ion and said: "O my son, tell me what took place with the Slave, the Jinni, now that God be praised, we have eaten and satisfied ourselves from his good things, and thou hast no excuse for saying to me, 'I am hungry.'" So, 'Ala-ed-Din told her all that had taken place between him and the Slave, while she was fallen in a swoon from affright. And sore amazement took hold upon her, and she said to him: "It is true, for the Jinn do appear before the son of Adam, though I, O my child, in all my days have never seen them; and I am thinking that this is the same that appeared to thee in the Treasury." But he replied: "It is not he, O my mother; this slave who appeared before thee is the Slave of the Lamp." And when she heard these words she said: "How is that, my son?" And he answered her: "This slave is different in aspect from that; and that one was the Slave of the Ring, and this which thou sawest is the Slave of the Lamp which was in thy hand".</p><p>And when she heard this she said: "Aha! that accursed, who appeared to me and nearly killed me with fright, belonged to the Lamp!" "Yes," he said, and she continued: "I adjure thee, O my son, by the milk which thou didst suck from me cast away this Lamp and Ring, since they will cause us great fear, and as for me, I cannot bide a second time to look at them. And it is forbidden us to deal with them, since the Prophet (God bless and save him!) hath warned us against them." And he said to her; "O my mother, thy behests be on my head and my eye! Yet as to this behest which thou hast spoken, it is not possible for me to abandon either the Lamp or the Ring. Thyself hast seen what good they did us when we were anhungered; and know, O my mother, that the Moor, the liar, the sorcerer, when I was sent down to the Treasury, wanted nought of the gold and silver of which the four chambers were full, but commanded me only to bring him the Lamp, and nought besides, because he knew its great value, and unless he had known that this was immense, he had not toiled and laboured and journeyed from his own country to ours in search of it, nor would he have imprisoned me in the Treasury when he despaired of the Lamp, when I would not give it to him. Therefore, O my mother, it behooveth us to hold fast by this Lamp and take care of it, for it is our sustenance, and shall make us rich, and we must not publish it abroad to anyone.</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="The-Story-Of-Ala-Ed-Din-And-The-Wonderful-Lamp-Part-6.html">The Story Of 'Ala-Ed-Din And The Wonderful Lamp.
