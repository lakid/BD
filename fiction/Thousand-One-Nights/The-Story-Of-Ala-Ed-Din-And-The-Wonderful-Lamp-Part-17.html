Part 17</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>Then 'Ala-ed-Din's mother returned home with the speed of the wind, and abated not the quickness of her pace, in order to congratulate her son. She flew with joy at thinking that her child was going to become the son-in-law of the Sultan. After she had gone, the Sultan dismissed the audience and entered the apartments of the Lady Bedr-el-Budur, and bade them bring the damsels and the bowls before her that she might look at them. And when they brought them and the Princess examined the jewels, she was amazed and said: " Methinks there is not found in the treasuries of the universe a single gem like these!"</p><p>Then she gazed upon the damsels and marvelled at their beauty and grace. And she knew that all this was from her new bridegroom, who had sent it in her service. So she rejoiced, though she had been sorrowful and sad on account of her bridegroom the son of the Wezir. Yet she rejoiced with great joy when she looked upon the jewels and the beauty of the damsels; and she made merry, and her father was greatly delighted at her cheerfulness, because he saw that her sadness and grief had departed from her. Then he asked her, saying: " O my daughter, Lady Bedr-el-Budur, does this astonish thee? Methinks this bridegroom of thine is goodlier than the Wezir's son; and presently, please God, O my daughter, thou^shalt enjoy supreme delight with him." Thus was it with the Sultan.</p><p>As for 'Ala-ed-Din, when his mother returned and entered the house, laughing in the excess of her joy, and he saw her so, he scented good news, and said: 'To God be praise everlasting! My desire is now accomplished." And his mother said; "Good news for thee, 0 my child! Cheer thy heart, and refresh thine eye for the fulfilment of thv law, and saith that to-night is the consummation. Moreover, he said to me: ' Let thy son come to me, that I may become acquainted with him and welcome him with all honour and regard.' And here am I, my son; my task is over; happen what may, it is now thy own affair".</p><p>Then 'Ala-ed-Din arose and kissed his mother's hand and thanked her, and magnified her goodness to him, and went and entered his chamber and took the Lamp and rubbed it, and behold, the Slave appeared, saying, "At | thy service! Ask what thou desirest." So 'Ala-ed-Din answered: "I desire thee to take me to a bath the equal of which existeth not in the universe; and bring me there a dress so royal and exceeding costly that Kings possess not its match." And the Marid replied, " I hear and obey." And he lifted him and took him into a bath such as Kings and Emperors never saw, all of marble and carnelian, with wonderful pictures which captivated the eye; and not a soul was there. In it was a hall studded over with splendid jewels, which when 'Ala-ed-Din entered, there came to him one of the Jann in human shape, who washed and kneaded him to the top of his bent. After which 'Ala-ed-Din went from the bath into the spacious hall, and found his old clothes gone and in their place a suit of royal robes. Then there was brought to him sherbet and coffee flavoured with ambergris. And he drank and arose, and a number of slaves appeared before him, and clad him in resplendent clothes, and he was dressed and perfumed and scented.</p><p>Though 'Ala-ed-Din was, in fact, a poor tailor's son, none would have supposed it, but rather would say: " This is the greatest of the sons of the Kings. Extolled be he who changeth others but himself changeth not!" Then the <a href="Nights-1-3-The-Story-Of-The-Merchant-And-The-Jinni.html">Jinni</a> came and lifted him and returned him to his house, and said: " O my master, hast thou further need ?99 And 'Ala-ed-Din replied: " Yes, I want thee to bring me forty-eight memluks, twenty-four to go before me and twenty-four to follow me, with their chargers and habiliments and arms; and everything on them and their horses must be of the very costliest, such as is not in the treasuries of Kings. Then bring me a stallion fit for the Caesars, and let his housings be of gold studded over with magnificent jewels; and bring me forty-eight thousand dinars, to each memluk a thousand. For I wish to go to the Sultan's presence. So delay not, since without all these things of which I have told thee I cannot visit him. Bring me also twelve damsels; they must be of peerless beauty, and clad in the most sumptuous raiment, that they may accompany my mother to the palace of the Sultan. And let each damsel be attired like the King's ladies." And the Slave answered, "I hear and obey." And vanishing awhile, he brought him in the twinkling of an eye, all that he had commanded; and he led a steed the fellow of which did not exist among the horses of the Arabs, and his housings were of gorgeous cloth of gold.</p><p>'Ala-ed-Din sent for his mother at once, and delivered to her the twelve maidens, and gave her robes that she might be robed, when the damsels would escort her to the palace of the Sultan. And he sent one of the memluks which the Jinni had brought him to tne Sultan, to ascertain whether he had come forth from hii harem or not. So the memluk went quicker than lightning, and returned to him speedily, saying: "O my master, the Sultan expecteth thee." Then 'Ala-ed-Din arose and mounted and the memluks rode before him and behind him. And they were such as to make all mea cry: "Extolled be the Lord who created them in such perfection of beauty and grace!" And they scattered gold among the people before their master 'Ala-ed-Din, who excelled them in beauty and comeliness,-and make no mention of the sons of Kings! Extolled be the Bountiful, the Eternal! And all this came by virtue of the <a href="Appendix-The-Story-Of-Ala-Ed-Din-And-The-Wonderful-Lamp.html">Wonderful Lamp</a>, which whoso possessed, it brought him beauty and loveliness and wealth and wisdom. And the people were astonished at the generosity of 'Ala-ed-Din and his excessive bounty, and were distraught as they gazed upon his beauty and comeliness and grace and courtliness. And they extolled the Compassionate for this his noble creation; and all blessed him, though they knew he was the son of Such-an-one the tailor; and none was envious of him, but all pronounced him worthy of his luck. Thus was the crowd dazzled by 'Ala-ed-Din and his bounty and generosity, as he was going to the palace, scattering gold. And they blessed him, great and small, till he reached the palace, with the memluks before and behind him distributing largesse to the people. Now the Sultan had assembled the grandees of the state, and informed them that he had given his word for the marriage of his daughter to 'Ala-ed-Din. And he bade them await his coming, and then go forth, one and all, and receive him. And he sent for the emirs and the wezirs and chamberlains and gentlemen of the guard and officers of the army, and they were all in waiting for 'Ala-ed-Din at the gate of the palace. Now when 'Ala-ed-Din arrived he would have dismounted at the gate, but one of the emirs whom the Sultan had appointed for the office approached and said: "O my master, the order is that thou enter and remain mounted on thy charger till thou comest to the gate of the Hall of Audience." And they all marched before him and escorted him to the gate of the Divan, when some of them approached and held his stirrup, and others supported him on each side or took him by the hand, and the emirs and officers of state went before him and led him into the Hall of Audience close to the royal throne. Then the Sultan descended at once from his throne, and clasped him to his breast, and forbidding him to kiss the ground, kissed him and seated him beside him on his right. And 'Ala-ed-Din did as was proper towards Kings, in giving salutations and benedictions, saying: "O our lord the Sultan, verily the generosity of thy Felicity caused thee to vouchsafe me the Lady Bedr-el-Budur thy daughter, although I am not worthy of so great an honour, %since I am of the meanest of thy slaves. And I leg God to prolong thy life perpetually. But in truth, O King, my tongue is powerless to thank thee for the greatness of the surpassing favours with which thou hast overwhelmed ine. And I beg of thy Felicity that thou give me a piece of land where I may build a palace suitable for the Lady Bedr-el-Budur." And the Sultan was bewildered as he gazed upon 'Ala-ed-Din in his princely robes, and looked upon him and considered his beauty and comeliness, and saw the memluks arrayed for his service and their handsome apparel. And his wonder increased when 'Ala-ed-Din's mother approached in her costly attire, sumptuous as though she had been a Queen; and when he perceived the twelve damsels attending her standing before her in all respect and worship. Further, the Sultan considered the eloquence of 'Ala-ed-Din, and the refinement of his language, and was astounded at it, he and all those who were with him at the levee. And fire was kindled in the heart of the Wezir for envy of 'Ala-ed-Din, till he almost died. Then the Sultan, after hearing 'Ala-ed-Din's benedictions, and perceiving the loftiness of his bearing and his deference and eloquence, pressed him to his bosom and kissed him, saying: "Alas for me, my son, that I have not enjoyed thy company till this day!"</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="The-Story-Of-Ala-Ed-Din-And-The-Wonderful-Lamp-Part-16.html">The Story Of 'Ala-Ed-Din And The Wonderful Lamp.
