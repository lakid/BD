Part 8</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>And as touching the Ring, in like manner I may not take it off my finger, since but for this ring thou hadst not seen me again alive, but I should have lain dead within the Treasury under the ground. Then how can I take it off my hand? And who knoweth what may befall me in life of troubles and perils and sore calamities, from which this Ring may deliver me? Only in deference to thy wishes I will conceal the Lamp, and never again constrain thee to look upon it." And when his mother had heard his words and had well weighed them, She perceived they were right, and said to him: "O my son, do as thou wilt; for myself, I wish never to see them again, nor would I willingly witness once more the terrible sight which I have seen." 'Ala-ed-Din and his mother continued eating of the viands which the <a href="Nights-1-3-The-Story-Of-The-Merchant-And-The-Jinni.html">Jinni</a> had brought them, two days, and then they were done. So perceiving that nothing remained to them to eat, he arose, and took one of the plates which the slave had brought on the tray, which were of pure gold, though he knew it not; and he went with it to the market. And there met him a Jew, viler than the devils, and to him he offered the plate. And when the Jew saw it, he took 'Ala-ed-Din aside so that none should see, and examined the plate carefully and assured himself that it was of fine gold; and not knowing whether 'Ala-ed-Din was acquainted with its worth or was inexperienced in such things, he said to him: "How much, O my master, is this dish?" And 'Ala-ed-Din answered, 'Thou knowest its value." And the Jew considered how much he should bid for it, since 'Ala-ed-Din had answered him a business-like answer; so he thought to offer him a small price, and yet he feared that 'Ala-ed-Din might know the value of it and expect to receive a high price. So he said within himself: "Perchance he is ignorant of it and knoweth not the value." Then he took from his pocket a dinar of gold and gave it him. And when 'Ala-ed-Din had looked at the piece of gold in his hand, he took it and quickly went away. So the Jew knew that the youth did not understand the value of the plate, so he repented with abject repentance that he had given him a dinar 1 instead of a carat of a sixtieth. 'Ala-ed-Din meanwhile did not tarry, but went to the baker's and bought of him bread and changed the dinar and took and went to his mother and gave her the bread and the change of the gold, and said to her: "O my mother, go and buy for us what we need." And she arose and went to the market and bought all they required, and they ate and were merry. And t every time the price of a plate was exhausted, 'Ala-ed-Din took another and went with it to the Jew, and the accursed Hebrew bought it of him for a pitiful price; and he would have reduced the price further, but he was afraid, as he had given him a dinar the first time, that if he reduced it the youth would go away and sell to some one else, and he would thus lose his usurious gains. And 'Ala-ed-Din ceased not to sell plate after plate till all were sold, and there remained only the tray on which the plates were set; and as this was large and heavy, he went and brought the Jew to his house, and shewed him the tray, and when he saw its size he gave him ten dinars, which 'Ala-ed-Din took, and the Jew departed. And 'Ala-ed-Din and his mother subsisted on the ten dinars till they were done.</p><p>Then 'Ala-ed-Din arose and fetched the Lamp, and rubbed it, and there appeared before him the Slave who had appeared to him before. And the Jinni said to him: "Command what thou wilt, O my master, for I am thy slave and the slave of him who* possesseth the Lamp." And 'Ala-ed-Din answered: "My desire is that thou bring me a tray of food like unto that which thou didst bring me before, for I am starving." Then, in the twinkling of an eye, the Slave brought him a tray, like the one he came with before; and on it were twelve plates of the richest, and on them the proper viands; and on the tray were also bottles of clear wine and white bread. Now 'Ala-ed-Din's mother had gone forth when she knew that her son intended to rub the Lamp, that she might not look a second time upon the Jinni; and presently she came home and perceived this tray, covered with dishes of silver, and the odour of rich viands permeating her house; and she wondered and rejoiced. And 'Ala-ed-Din said to her: " See, O my mother, thou didst tell me to cast away the Lamp; behold now its advantages!"</p><p>And she answered: "O my son, God multiply his weal! but I would not look upon him." Then rAla-ed-Din and his mother sal down to the tray, and ate and drank till they were satisfied; and they put aside what was left for the morrow. And when the food they had was finished, 'Ala-ed-Din arose and took a plate of the plates of the tray under his garment and sallied forth in quest of the Jew to sell it to him; but by the decrees of destiny he passed by the shop of a jeweller, who was a just man and feared God. And when the jeweller sheykh saw 'Ala-ed-Din he questioned him, saying: " O my son, what dost thou want ? for I have seen thee often passing by, and thou wast dealing with a Jewish man, and I have seen thee making over to him various things, and I am thinking that thou hast something with thee now, and thou seekest him to buy it. But thou dost not know, O my son, that the property of the Muslims, who profess the Unity of God Most High, is fair spoil to the Jews, who always defraud them, and worst of all this damned Jew with whom thou hast dealt and into whose hands thou hast fallen. So if thou hast with thee, O my son, anything thou wishest to sell, shew it me, and fear not at all, for I will give thee its value by the truth of the Most High God." So 'Ala-ed-Din produced the plate before the sheykh, who when he had looked upon it, took it and weighed it in his balance, and questioned 'Ala-ed-Din and said: " Didst thou sell the like of this to the Jew ?" And he answered, "Yes, its like and its brother." And the other said: "How much did he give thee for its price?" And he answered. " He gave me a dinar." And when the sheykh heard from 'Ala-ed-Din that the Jew had given him only a single dinar for the price of the plate, he exclaimed: " Woe to this accursed who cheats the servants of the Most High God!" And looking at 'Ala-ed-Din he said: " O my son, verily this rascally Jew hath cheated thee and mocked at thee; for thy plate fs of fine virgin silver; and I have weighed it and found its value to be seventy dinars. So if thou wilt take its price, take it." And the jeweller sheykh counted out to him seventy dinars, and 'Ala-ed Din took them, and thanked him for his kindness in shewing him the Jew's fraud. And whenever the price of a plate was gone, he went and brought another, so that he and his mother became well to do, though they ceased not to live as of old, as middle-class people, without excess or waste.</p><p>'Ala-ed-Din had cast aside his gracelessness and shunned vagabonds, and chose for his companions upright men, and went every day to the market of the merchants and sat with the great and the small of them, and asked them concerning matters of business and the price of investments and the rest. And he would visit the market of the goldsmiths and jewellers; and there he would sit and divert himself with looking at the jewels and how they were bought and sold there. And thus he learned that the pockets full of fruit which he had gathered in the Treasury were not of glass or crystal, but were precious stones. And he knew that he had become possessed of vast riches such as Kings could never amass. And he examined all the stones that were in the market of the jewellers and found that their very biggest was not equal to his smallest. And he ceased not each day to saunter to the Bazar of the Jewellers and make acquaintance with the people, and obtain their good-will, and inquire of them concerning buying and selling and taking and giving and the dear and the cheap; till one day, after rising betimes and putting on his dress, he went as was his wont to the Bazar of the Jewellers, and as he passed he heard the herald calling thus: " By command of the gracious patron, King of the Time, Lord of the Age and the Season: now let all the people close their stores and shops and enter in unto their houses, because Bedr-el-Budur, the daughter of the Sultan, intendeth to visit the bath; and whoso disobeyeth the order, death is his penalty, and his blood be on his own head." And when 'Ala-ed-Din heard this proclamation, he longed to look upon the Sultan's daughter, and said within himself: " Verily all the folk talk of her beauty and loveliness, and the summit of my ambition is to behold her." So 'Ala-ed-Din set himself to seek a way whereby he might attain to a sight of the daughter of the Sultan, the Lady Bedr-el-Budur; and it seemed best to him to stand behind the door of the Hammam, so as to see her face when she came in. Accordingly, without any delay, he went to the bath before she was expected and stood behind the door, a place where no one could see him; and when the daughter of the Sultan drew near, after going about the city and its quarters and diverting herself thereby, she came to the bath, and on entering, lifted her veil and displayed her face, as it were a radiant sun or a pearl of great price; for she was as the poet sang:</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="The-Story-Of-Ala-Ed-Din-And-The-Wonderful-Lamp-Part-7.html">The Story Of 'Ala-Ed-Din And The Wonderful Lamp.
