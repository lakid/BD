Part 3</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>At last she pitied his case, and removed the charm, and the horns dropped down on the ground, and he would have killed her on the spot, only he was as weak as water, and his fellow-servants came in, and carried him up to the big house.</p><p>Well, some way or other, the story came to the ears of the prince, and he strolled down that way. She had only the dress of a country-woman on her as she sat sewing at the window, but that did not hide her beauty, and he was greatly puzzled and disturbed, after he had a good look at her features, just as a body is perplexed to know whether something happened to him when he was young, or if he only dreamed it. Well, the witch's daughter heard about it too, and she came to see the strange girl; and what did she find her doing, but cutting out the pattern of a gown from brown paper; and as she cut away, the paper became the richest silk she ever saw. The lady looked on with very covetous eyes, and, says she, " What would you be satisfied to take for that scissors ?" " I'll take nothing," says she, " but leave to spend one night in the prince's chamber, and I'll swear that we'll be as innocent of any crime next morning as we were in the evening." Well, the proud lady fired up, and was going to say something dreadful; but the scissors kept on cutting, arid the silk growing richer and richer every inch. So she agreed, and made her take a great oath to keep her promise.</p><p>When night came on she was let into her husband's chamber, and the door was locked. But, when she came in a tremble, and sat by the bed-side, the prince was in such a dead sleep, that all she did couldn't awake him. She sung this verse to him, sighing and sobbing, and kept singing it the night long, and it was all in vain :-</p><p>" Four long years I was married to thee ; Three sweet babes I bore to thee ; <a href="The-Brown-Bear-Of-Norway.html">Brown Bear of Norway</a>, won't you turn to me ? "</p><p>At the first dawn, the proud lady was in the chamber, and led her away, and the footman of the horns put out his tongue at her as she was quitting the palace.</p><p>So there was no luck so far; but the next day the prince passed by again, and looked at her, and saluted her kindly, as a prince might a farmer's daughter, and passed on ; and soon the witch's daughter came by, and found her combing her hair, and pearls and diamonds dropping from it.</p><p>Well, another bargain was made, and the princess spent another night of sorrow, and she left the castle at daybreak, and the footman was at his post, and enjoyed his revenge.</p><p>The third day the prince went by, and stopped to talk with the strange woman. He asked her could he do anything to serve her, and she said he might. She asked him did he ever wake at night. He said that he was rather wakeful than otherwise ; but that during the last two nights, he was listening to a sweet song in his dreams, and could not wake, and that the voice was one that he must have known and loved in some other world long ago. Says she, " Did you drink any sleepy posset either of these evenings before you went to bed ? " "I did," said he. " The two evenings my wife gave me something to drink, but I don't know whether it was a sleepy posset or not." " Well, prince," said she, " as you say you would wish to oblige me, you can do it by not tasting any drink this afternoon." " I will not," says he, and then he went on his walk.</p><p>Well, the great lady was soon after the prince, and found the stranger using her hand-reel and winding threads of gold off it, and the third bargain was made.</p><p>That evening the prince was lying on his bed at twilight, and his mind much disturbed; and the door opened, and in his princess walked, and down she sat by his bed-side, and sung ;-</p><p>" Four long years I was married to thee ; Three sweet babes I bore to thee ; Brown Bear of Norway, won't you turn to me ? "</p><p>"Brown Bear of Norway!" said he : "I don't understand you." "Don't you remember, prince, that I was your wedded wife for four years ? " "I do not," said he, " but I'm sure I wish it was so." " Don't you remember our three babes, that are still alive ? " " Show me them. My mind is all a heap of confusion." " Look for the half of our marriage ring, that hangs at your neck, and fit it to this." He did so, and the same moment the charm was broken. His full memory came back on him, and he flung his arms round his wife's neck, and both burst into tears.</p><p>Well, there was a great cry outside, and the castle walls were heard splitting and cracking. Every one in the castle was alarmed, and made their way out. The prince and princess went with the rest, and by the time all were safe on the lawn, down came the building, and made the ground tremble for miles round. No one ever saw the witch and her daughter afterwards. It was not long till the prince and princess had their children with them, and then they set out for their own palace. The kings of Ireland, and of Munster and Ulster, and their wives, soon came to visit them, and may every one that deserves it be as happy as the Brown Bear of Norway and his family.</p><p>The <a href="The-Goban-Saor.html">Goban Saor</a>, pronounced Gubawn Seer (free smith, free mason, or free carpenter, in fact), is a relative of Wayland Smith, or Vcelund, in the Vcelundar Quida ; but with equal skill he is endowed with more mother wit than the Northern craftsman. Unconnected adventures of this character are met with in every country of Europe. It is probable that a more complete legend concerning this celebrated gow (Smith) would be met with in Mayo or Kerry. Vulcan or Prometheus was the original craftsman; perhaps Daedalus might dispute the honour with them. These old-world legends have reached our time and our province in an unsatisfactory and degraded state. All that remains to us is to make the most we can of our materials.</p><p>Our smith is a more moral, as well as a more fortunate man, than the Vcelund of the Northern saga. Vcelund returns evil for evil, and the master smith of MM. Asbjornsen and Moe is altogether unprincipled. He cuts off horses' legs to shoe them with the greater ease to himself, and sets an old woman in his furnace, in the vague hope that he may hammer her into a fresh young lass when she is hot enough.</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="The-Brown-Bear-Of-Norway-Part-2.html">The Brown Bear Of Norway.
