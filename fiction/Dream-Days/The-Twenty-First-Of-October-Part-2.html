Part 2</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>October was mellowing fast, and with it the year itself; full of tender hints, in woodland and hedgerow, of a course well-nigh completed. From all sides that still afternoon you caught the quick breathing and sob of the runner nearing the goal. Preoccupied and possessed, Selina had strayed down the garden and out into the pasture beyond, where, on a bit of rising ground that dominated the garden on one side and the downs with the old coach-road on the other, she had cast herself down to chew the cud of fancy. There she was presently joined by Harold, breathless and very full of his latest grievance.</p><p>" I asked him not to," he burst out. " I said if he'd only please wait a bit and Edward would be back soon, and it could n't matter to him, and the pig would n't mind, and Edward'd be pleased and everybody'd be happy. But he just said he was very sorry, but bacon did n't wait for nobody. So I told him he was a regular beast, and then I came away. And - and I b'lieve they're doing it now!"</p><p>"Yes, he's a beast," agreed Selina, absently. She had forgotten all about the pig-killing. Harold kicked away a freshly thrown-up mole-hill, and prodded down the hole with a stick. From the direction of Farmer Larkin's demesne came a long-drawn note of sorrow, a thin cry and appeal, telling that the stout soul of a black Berkshire pig was already faring down the stony track to Hades.</p><p>" D 'you know what day it is ?" said Selina presently, in a low voice, looking far away before her.</p><p>Harold did not appear to know, nor yet to care. He had laid open his mole-run for a yard or so, and was still grubbing at it absorbedly.</p><p>"It's Trafalgar Day," went on Selina, trancedly; "Trafalgar Day-and nobody cares! "</p><p>Something in her tone told Harold that he was not behaving quite becomingly. He did n't exactly know in what manner; still, he abandoned his mole-hunt for a more courteous attitude of attention.</p><p>"Over there," resumed Selina - she was gazing out in the direction of the old highroad - " over there the coaches used to go by. Uncle Thomas was telling me about it the other day. And the people used to watch for 'em coming, to tell the time by, and p'r'aps to get their parcels. And one morning - they would n't be expecting anything different-one morning, first there would be a cloud of dust, as usual, and then the coach would come racing by, and then they would know! For the coach would be dressed in laurel, all laurel from stem to stern! And the coachman would be wearing laurel, and the guard would be wearing laurel; and then they would know, then they would know! "</p><p>Harold listened in respectful silence. He would much rather have been hunting the mole, who must have been a mile away by this time if he had his wits about him. But he had all the natural instincts of a gentleman; of whom it is one of the principal marks, if not the complete definition, never to show signs of being bored.</p><p>Selina rose to her feet, and paced the turf restlessly with a short quarter-deck walk.</p><p>"Why can't we do something?" she burst out presently. " He - he did everything - why can't we do anything for him?"</p><p>" Who did everything?" inquired Harold, meekly. It was useless wasting further longings on that mole. Like the dead, he travelled fast. *</p><p>" Why, Nelson, of course," said Selina, shortly, still looking restlessly around for help or suggestion.</p><p>"But he's -he's dead, isn't he?" asked Harold, slightly puzzled.</p><p>" What's that got to do with it ? " retorted his sister, resuming her caged-lion promenade.</p><p>Harold was somewhat taken aback. In the case of the pig, for instance, whose last outcry had now passed into stillness, he had considered the chapter as finally closed. Whatever innocent mirth the holidays might hold in store for Edward, that particular pig, at least, would not be a contributor. And now he was given to understand that the situation had not materially changed! He would have to revise his ideas, it seemed. Sitting up on end, he looked towards the garden for assistance in the task. Thence, even as he gazed, a tiny column of smoke rose straight up into the still air. The gardener had been sweeping that afternoon, and now, an unconscious priest, was offering his sacrifice of autumn leaves to the calm-eyed goddess of changing hues and chill forebodings who was moving slowly about the land that golden afternoon. Harold was up and off in a moment, forgetting Nelson, forgetting the pig, the mole, the Larkin betrayal, and Selina's strange fever of conscience. Here was fire, real fire, to play with, and that was even better than messing with water, or remodelling the plastic surface of the earth. Of all the toys the world provides for right-minded persons, the original elements rank easily the first.</p><p>But Selina sat on where she was, her chin on her fists; and her fancies whirled and drifted, here and there, in curls and eddies, along with the smoke she was watching. As the quick-footed dusk of the short October day stepped lightly over the garden, little red tongues of fire might be seen to leap and vanish in the smoke. Harold, anon staggering under armfuls of leaves, anon stoking vigorously, was discernible only at fitful intervals. It was another sort of smoke that the inner eye of Selina was looking upon, - a smoke that hung in sullen banks round the masts and the hulls of the fighting ships; a smoke from beneath which came thunder and the crash and the splinter-rip, the shout of the boarding-party, the choking sob of the gunner stretched by his gun; a smoke from out of which at last she saw, as through a riven pall, the radiant spirit of the Victor, crowned with the coronal of a perfect death, leap in full assurance up into the ether that Immortals breathe. The dusk was glooming towards darkness when she rose and moved slowly down towards the beckoning fire; something of the priestess in her stride, something of the devotee in the set purpose of her eye.</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="The-Twenty-First-Of-October.html">The Twenty-First Of October</a></li><li><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></li><li>next: <a href="The-Twenty-First-Of-October-Part-3.html">The Twenty-First Of October.
