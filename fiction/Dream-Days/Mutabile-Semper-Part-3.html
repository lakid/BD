Part 3</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>Selina had a fit of the fidgets, bred of the unpromising weather, and, instead of settling down to something on her own account, must needs walk round and annoy us artists, intent on embodying our conceptions of the ideal. She had been looking over my shoulder some minutes before I knew of it; or I would have had a word or two to say upon the subject.</p><p>" I suppose you call that thing a ship," she remarked contemptuously. " Who ever heard of a pink ship? Hoo-hoo ! "</p><p>I stifled my wrath, knowing that in order to score properly it was necessary to keep a cool head.</p><p>" There is a pink ship," I observed with forced calmness, " lying in the toyshop window now. You can go and look at it if you like. D' you suppose you know more about ships than the fellows who make 'em ? "</p><p>Selina, baffled for the moment, returned to the charge presently.</p><p>" Those are funny things, too," she observed. " S'pose they 're meant to be trees. But they 're blue."</p><p>"They are trees," I replied with severity; " and they are blue. They've got to be blue, 'cos you stole my gamboge last week, so I can't mix up any green."</p><p>" Did n't steal your gamboge," declared Selina, haughtily, edging away, however, in the direction of Harold. " And I would n't tell lies, either, if I was you, about a dirty little bit of gamboge."</p><p>I preserved a discreet silence. After all, I knew she knew she stole my gamboge.</p><p>The moment Harold became conscious of Selina's stealthy approach, he dropped his pencil and flung himself flat upon the table, protecting thus his literary efforts from chilling criticism by the interposed thickness of his person. From somewhere in his interior proceeded a heartrending compound of squeal and whistle, as of escaping steam, - long-drawn, ear-piercing, unvarying in note.</p><p>" I only just want to see/' protested Selina, struggling to uproot his small body from the scrawl it guarded. But Harold clung limpet-like to the table edge, and his shrill protest continued to deafen humanity and to threaten even the serenities of Olympus. The time seemed come for a demonstration in force. Personally I cared little what soul-outpourings of Harold were pirated by Selina - she was pretty sure to get hold of them sooner or later - and indeed I rather welcomed the diversion as favourable to the undisturbed pursuit of Art. But the clannishness of sex has its unwritten laws. Boys, as such, are sufficiently put upon, maltreated, trodden under, as it is. Should they fail to hang together in perilous times, what disasters, what ignominies, may not be looked for? Possibly even an extinction of the tribe. I dropped my paint brush and sailed shouting into the fray.</p><p>The result for a short space hung dubious. There is a period of life when the difference of a year or two in age far outweighs the minor advantage of sex. Then the gathers of Selina's frock came away with a sound like the rattle of distant musketry; and this calamity it was, rather than mere brute compulsion, that quelled her indomitable spirit.</p><p>The female tongue is mightier than the sword, as I soon had good reason to know, when Selina, her riven garment held out at length, avenged her discomfiture with the Greek-fire of personalities and abuse. Every black incident in my short, but not stainless, career - every vror, every folly, every penalty ignobly suffered - were paraded before me as in a magic-lantern show. The information, however, was not particularly new to me, and the effect was staled by previous rehearsals. Besides, a victory remains a victory, whatever the moral character of the triumphant general.</p><p>Harold chuckled and crowed as he dropped from the table, revealing the document over which so many gathers had sighed their short lives out. " You can read it if you like," he said to me gratefully. " It's only a Death-letter."</p><p>It had never been possible to say what Harold's particular amusement of the hour might turn out to be. One thing only was certain, that it would be something improbable, unguessable, not to be foretold. Who, for instance, in search of relaxation, would ever dream of choosing the drawing-up of a testamentary disposition of property? Yet this was the form taken by Harold's latest craze; and in justice this much had to be said for him, that in the christening of his amusement he had gone right to the heart of the matter. The words "will" and "testament " have various meanings and uses; but about the signification of "death-letter " there can be no manner of doubt. I smoothed out the crumpled paper and read. In actual form it deviated considerably from that usually adopted by family solicitors of standing, the only resemblance, indeed, lying in the absence of punctuation.</p><p>" my dear edward (it ran) when I die I leave all my muny to you my walkin sticks wips my crop my sord and gun bricks forts and all things i have goodbye my dear charlotte when i die I leave you my wach and cumpus and pencel case my salors and camperdown my picteres and evthing goodbye your loving brother armen my dear Martha I love you very much i leave you my garden my mice and rabets my plants in pots when I die please take care of them my dear - " Cetera desunt</p><p>" Why, you 're not leaving me anything !" exclaimed Selina, indignantly. " You 're a regular mean little boy, and I'll take back the last birthday present I gave you ! "</p><p>" I don't care," said Harold, repossessing himself of the document. " I was going to leave you something, but I sha' n't now, 'cos you tried to read my death-letter before I was dead ! "</p><p>" Then I'll write a death-letter myself," retorted Selina, scenting an artistic vengeance : " and I sha'n't leave you a single thing! " And she went off in search of a pencil.</p><p>The tempest within-doors had kept my attention off the condition of things without. But now a glance through the window told me that the rain had entirely ceased, and that everything was bathed instead in a radiant glow of sunlight, more golden than any gamboge of mine could possibly depict. Leaving Selina and Harold to settle their feud by a mutual disinheritance, I slipped from the room and escaped into the open air, eager to pick up the loose end of my new friendship just where I had dropped it that morning. In the glorious reaction of the sunshine after the downpour, with its moist warm smells, bespanglement of greenery, and inspiriting touch of rain-washed air, the parks and palaces of the imagination glowed with a livelier iris, and their blurred beauties shone out again with fresh blush and palpitation. As I sped along to the tryst, again I accompanied my new comrade along the corridors of my pet palace into which I had so hastily introduced her; and on reflection I began to see that it would n't work properly. I had made a mistake, and those were not the surroundings in which she was most fitted to shine. However, it really did not matter much; I had other palaces to place at her disposal - plenty of 'em; and on a further acquaintance with and knowledge of her tastes, no doubt I could find something to suit her.</p><p>There was a real Arabian one, for instance, which I visited but rarely - only just when I was in the fine Oriental mood for it; a wonder of silk hangings, fountains of rosewater, pavilions, and minarets. Hundreds of silent, well-trained slaves thronged the stairs and alleys of this establishment, ready to fetch and carry for her all day, if she wished it; and my brave soldiers would be spared the indignity. Also there were processions through the bazaar at odd moments - processions with camels, elephants, and palanquins. Yes, she was more suited for the East, this imperious young person; and I determined that thither she should be personally conducted as soon as ever might be.</p><p>I reached the fence and climbed up two bars of it, and leaning over I looked this way and that for my twin-souled partner of the morning. It was not long before I caught sight of her, only a short distance away. Her back was towards me and - well, one can never foresee exactly how one will find things - she was talking to a Boy.</p><p>Of course there are boys and boys, and Lord knows I was never narrow. But this was the parson's son from an adjoining village, a red-headed boy and as common a little beast as ever stepped. He cultivated ferrets - his only good point; and it was evidently through the medium of this art that he was basely supplanting me, for her head was bent absorbedly over something he carried in his hands.</p><p>With some trepidation I called out, " Hi! " But answer there was none. Then again I called, " Hi! " but this time with a sickening sense of failure and of doom. She replied only by a complex gesture, decisive in import if not easily described. A petulant toss of the head, a jerk of the left shoulder, and a backward kick of the left foot, all delivered at once - that was all, and that was enough. The red-headed boy never even condescended to glance my way. Why, indeed, should he? I dropped from the fence without another effort, and took my way homewards along the weary road.</p><p>Little inclination was left to me, at first, for any solitary visit to my accustomed palace, the pleasures of which I had so recently tasted in company; and yet after a minute or two I found myself, from habit, sneaking off there much as usual. Presently I became aware of a certain solace and consolation in my newly-recovered independence of action. Quit of all female whims and fanciful restrictions, I rowed, sailed, or punted, just as I pleased; in the Chocolate-room I cracked and nibbled the hard sticks, with a certain contempt for those who preferred the soft, veneered article; and I mixed and quaffed countless fizzy drinks without dread of any prohibitionist. Finally, I swaggered into the park, paraded all my soldiers on the terrace, and, bidding them take the time from me, gave the order to fire off all the guns.</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="Mutabile-Semper-Part-2.html">Mutabile Semper.
