Part 4</h1><div class="contentbody"><p>Gilpin also doubts the expedience of the alterations Brown was carrying out at Roche Abbey, when he visited that place. Brown, it is said, was himself unable to draw a line, and had had no artistic training, or education sufficient to understand the historical interest, or natural beauties of the scenes he tried to improve. It is therefore not to be wondered at that he signally failed, on many occasions, in his endeavours to create a more suitable landscape. "Many modern places," wrote Gilpin, "he has adorned and beautified, but a ruin presented a new idea, which I doubt whether he has sufficiently considered. He has finished one of the valleys which look towards Laughton spire: he has floated it with a lake, and formed it into a very beautiful scene. But I fear it is too-magnificent and too-artificial an appendage to be in unison with the ruins of an Abbey.".* He levelled all the ground round the old Abbey, leaving the walls and pillars standing in "a neat bowling-green," and he removed all the overgrown pieces of ruin and mounds, which showed the old lines of the building, and even took stones from the Abbey to make the dam in the river, and get the effect of a water-fall. Gilpin most sarcastically remarks, " If Mr. Brown should proceed a step further, pull down the ruin, and build an elegant mansion, everything would then be right." Some of Brown's handiwork about the ruins has of late been removed, and their former conditions, as much as possible, restored.</p><img width="500" alt="BURGHLEY.

Some features then, at least, we should obtain To mark this flat, insipid, waving plain : Some vary'd tints and forms would intervene To break this uniform, eternal green".</p><p>Although Brown was assailed by Gilpin, Price, Knight, and Mason, he had many adherents and imitators. Repton is the best known of these. He was an admirer of Brown's works, and carried out designs in the same style. As, however, men had now begun to find out Brown's mistakes, and reflect on his destruction of old places and historical relics, Repton could scarcely venture to suggest such sweeping alterations as Brown had made. Repton was openly an opponent of those who wrote against Brown, yet their ideas evidently influenced his judgment. He did not always alter all he found at a place, before commencing additions ; and he did not entirely confine himself to the " landscape" style. He maintained that a " Flower garden should be an object detached and distinct from the general scenery of the place; and whether large or small, whether varied or formal, it ought to be protected from hares and smaller animals by an inner fence; within this enclosure rare plants of every description should be encouraged, and provision made of soil, and aspect for every different class. Beds of bog earth should be prepared for the American plants : the aquatic plants, some of which are peculiarly beautiful, should grow on the surface or near the edges of water. The numerous class of rock-plants should have beds of rugged stone provided, without the affectation of such stones being the natural production of the soil ; but, above all, there should be poles or hoops for those kind of creeping plants which spontaneously form themselves into graceful festoons when encouraged and supported by art." * Such was Repton's idea of a flower-garden, but that was to form but a small portion of the design and its very existence seemed to him to require an apology. He boasts that he had " frequently been the means of restoring acres of useless garden to the deer or sheep, to which they more properly belong," yet he sometimes designed a small formal garden for flowers. The " Dutch garden" at Hewell Grange was made according to his suggestions. † It is a semicircle, surrounded by a cut Thuja hedge, and a high brick wall across the straight side. The beds within are edged with box, between which are small gravel paths tiled in the middle, and a sundial in the centre of the garden. He also designed the lawn and rock-garden while an older French garden, approached by cut yew hedges, he did not interfere with. Much as he disliked avenues as being " utterly inconsistent with Natural scenery,"* he occasionally respected "such marks of ancient dignity." At Finedon, although he thought the view " encumbered " by the vicarage and church, and said the garden wall, malt-house, pigeon-house, and even part of the village " must be removed," he spared the avenue called the " Holly Walk".</p><p>* " The Landscape," A didactic poem in III Books, addressed to Sir Uvedale Price by R.
