He asks only the same rights as are allowed without question to all other men in America - the protection of the courts, the right to select his own religion, dress, amusements, and the equal right to the pursuit of happiness so long as his methods do not conflict with the greater law of the land.
</dd></dl><dl class="toc"><dt><a href="camping/Scouts-Woodcraft-Camp/index.html"><img src="../images/nav/arrow_right.gif" alt="-" align="bottom" border="0" height="10" width="18">The Boy Scouts of Woodcraft Camp | by Thornton W. Burgess</a></dt><dd>In this and succeeding volumes, " The Boy Scouts on Swift River," " The Boy Scouts on Lost Trail," " The Boy Scouts in a Trapper's Camp," I have sought to portray the life of such a school camp under Boy Scout rules. " The Boy Scouts of Woodcraft Camp " has been written with a twofold purpose: To stimulate on the part of every one of my boy readers a desire to master for himself the mysteries of nature's great out-of-doors, the secrets of field and wood and stream, and to show by example what the Boy Scout's oath means in the development of character.
</dd></dl><dl class="toc"><dt><a href="Camping-Woodcraft/index.html"><img src="../images/nav/arrow_right.gif" alt="-" align="bottom" border="0" height="10" width="18">Camping And Woodcraft | by Horace Kephart</a></dt><dd>This book was intended as a pocket manual for those who travel where there are no roads and who perforce must go light. I took little thought of the fast-growing multitude who go to more accessible places and camp out just for the pleasure and healthfulness of open-air life. It had seemed to me that outfitting a party for fixed camp within reach of wagons was so simple that nobody would want advice about it. But I have learned that such matters are not so easy to the multitude as I had assumed; and there are, to be sure, " wrinkles," plenty of them, in equipping and managing stationary camps that save trouble, annoyance, or expense. Consequently I am adding several chapters expressly for that class of campers, and I treat the matter of outfitting much more fully than before.

This lamentable state of affairs caused the writer so much real pain and concern that he then and there inaugurated a personal crusade for the benefit of the boys, a crusade with the avowed object of winning for them the peoples' interest in the big outdoors.

Gardens and gardening, too, are to be treated of, and will again receive the attention of one who has never yet failed to enrich English literature when he has taken up his pen to write on the well-loved theme.

He, however, believes himself to be not altogether without qualifications for the undertaking, as he has spent the greater part of twenty-five years in the forests of the low-country, and has thus had, of necessity, many opportunities of observing the habits of wild animals and of learning by experience the best, pleasantest and cheapest ways of obtaining sport. It is not expected that experienced sportsmen will learn anything new from the following pages, but it is hoped that the little book will be found useful by strangers and new-comers going on their first shooting trip to the low-country.

B. Lodge</a></dt><dd>A most interesting expedition could be made now in pursuit of the Eagles and Vultures of Southern Europe. In Spain alone there are still to be found, in the big pine-woods and rugged sierras, five different kinds of Eagles and four kinds of Vultures. Some of these are yearly decreasing in numbers, and in a few more years will be extremely rare. Hungary and the country round the Danube is also particularly rich in raptorial and marsh birds.

The engineer who hopes to get to the head of his profession has to pass through the drudgery of the workshop before he can rise to a higher plane. The smallest detail and the ordinary routine of any business or pleasure ought to be at the finger-ends of the man who wishes to become the real and not the nominal controller of the people he employs. These truisms are so well known that it may seem unnecessary to set them down here, but it is as well to impress them on your memory, as we are all rather inclined to fly before we can walk.

These notes are only intended as headings to draw the attention of young sportsmen to what they ought to know and what they ought not to forget.

T. Newall</a></dt><dd>The principal sport treated of is that of Hog-hunting. I have endeavoured, both by pen and pencil, to give to the uninitiated some general idea of this sport to my mind one of the most attractive in the world as I have enjoyed it in the countries indicated. This appears to me to be the simplest maimer of bringing together a number of anecdotes of sport occurring at widely-separated periods and places.
