Shropshire. England. Imported in 1874, by his present under date of March 31st, 1875. Bred in 1869 by Laverack ner Mr Charles H Raymond. Pride of the Border is a white dog, with liver mark tags, and is sire of Mr. Laverack's celebrated Stock and Field Dos. Blue Prince; Mr. Dary Hollin Silk Toryy; Langsion's Blue Peter, prize winners at Birmingham andManchester; Mr. Pickets Blue Dash, and of many other highly valued <a href="Comparative-Virtues-Oe-Pointer-And-Setter.html">Setters</a>.</p><p>Fox Farm.

It is extremely difficult to assign a distinctive name to this breed. Some incline to the belief that it is analogous to the southern hound; by some it is styled Welsh mastiff, and by others a cross with (with what not stated) the English <a href="The-Bloodhound.html">bloodhound</a>. The question of any suspicion of bloodhound is met by the dissimilarity of the ears which in the bloodhound are long, fine, and pendulous; whereas in this dog they are short and a little coarse, and, when excited, are slightly "pricked ;"' and whereas the bloodhound, as well as the mastiff, is well known to be averse to water, this breed would almost live in it. It is not improbable that it is a descendant of the hounds used in the chase centuries since, when wolves were common in England, the keenness of their scent being very fine.</p><p>The dog is the property of Mr. Howel W. Williams, of Swansea, Wales.</p><img width="500" alt="Nero The Largest Dog In Europe 83" src="images/Nero-The-Largest-Dog-In-Europe-83.jpg" height="316"><img width="500" alt="Bruno" src="images/Bruno.jpg" height="531"><p>Bruno</p><p>Nunquam Dormio.</p><img width="500" alt="Nunquam Dormio." src="images/Nunquam-Dormio.jpg" height="710"></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="Glossary-Of-Words-Used-By-The-Fancy.html">Glossary Of Words Used By The Fancy</a></li><li><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></li></ul><h1>Tags</h1><p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=dogs">dogs</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=animal">animal</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=disease">disease</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=breeding">breeding</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=training">training</a></p><!-- SwishCommand noindex --></div><br><!-- content end --><br /><!-- AddThis Button BEGIN --><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_2"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_3"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_4"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a><a class="addthis_counter addthis_bubble_style"></a></div><script type="text/javascript">var addthis_config = {"data_track_addressbar":true};</script><script type="text/javascript" src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-538af58830863a24"></script><!-- AddThis Button END --><br /><div class="hidden-phone"><br /><script type="text/javascript"><!--
