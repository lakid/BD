It doesn't see him often Of late years, though he keeps the old homestead</p><p>And sends the children down there with their mother</p><p>To run wild in the summer-a little wild. Sometimes he joins them for a day or two And sees old friends he somehow can't get near.</p><p>They meet him in the general store at night, Pre-occupied with formidable mail, Rifling a printed letter as he talks. They seem afraid. He wouldn't have it so: Though a great scholar, he's a democrat, If not at heart, at least on principle. Lately when coming up to Lancaster His train being late he missed another train</p><p>And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction</p><p>After eleven o'clock at night. Too tired To think of sitting such an ordeal out, He turned to the hotel to find a bed.</p><p>"No room," the night cleric said. ".Unless-"</p><p>Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps</p><p>And cars that shook and rattle-and one hotel.</p><p>"You say'unless.'"</p><p>" Unless you wouldn't mind Sharing a room with someone else."</p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p>"A man."</p><p>" So I should hope. What kind of man? "</p><p>" I know him: he's all right. A man's a man. Separate beds of course you understand."</p><p>The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on.</p><p>"Who's that man sleeping in the office chair? Has he had the refusal of my chance ? "</p><p>" He was afraid of being robbed or murdered. What do you say?"</p><p>" I'll have to have a bed."</p><p>The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs</p><p>And down a narrow passage full of doors, At the last one of which he knocked and entered.</p><p>"Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room."</p><p>" Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him. I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself."</p><p>The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot. "This will be yours. Good-night," he said, and went</p><p>" Lafe was the name, I think ? "</p><p>" Yes, Loyfayette. You got it the first time. And yours?"</p><p>" Magoon.</p><p>Doctor Magoon."</p><p>"A Doctor?"</p><p>"Well, a teacher."</p><p>" Professor Square-the-circle-till-you're-tired? Hold on, there's something I don't think of now</p><p>That I had on my mind to ask the first Man that knew anything I happened in with. Fll ask you later-don't let me forget it."</p><p>The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away. A man? A brute. Naked above the waist, He sat there creased and shining in the light, Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt. " Pm moving into a size-larger shirt.</p><p>I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it. I just found what the matter was to-night: I've been a-choking like a nursery tree When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag.</p><p>I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having. Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back, Not liking to own up I'd grown a size. Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?"</p><p>The Doctor caught his throat convulsively. " Oh-ah-fourteen-fourteen."</p><p>"Fourteen! You say so! I can remember when I wore fourteen. And come to think I must have back at home</p><p>More than a hundred collars, size fourteen. Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them.</p><p>They're yours and welcome; let me send them to you.</p><p>What makes you stand there on one leg like that?</p><p>You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you.</p><p>You act as if you wished you hadn't come. Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous/'</p><p>The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, And propped himself at bay against a pillow.</p><p>"Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed.</p><p>You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off."</p><p>" Don't touch me, please-I say, don't touch</p><p>me, please. Pll not be put to bed by you, my man."</p><p>" Just as you say. Have it your own way then. ' My man' is it? You talk like a professor. Speaking of who's afraid of who, however, I'm thinking I have more to lose than you If anything should happen to be wrong. Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat!</p><p>Let's have a show down as an evidence Of good faith. There is ninety dollars. Come, if you're not afraid."</p><p>" I'm not afraid. There's five: that's all I carry."</p><p>" I can search you? Where are you moving over to? Stay still. You'd better tuck your money under you And sleep on it the way I always do When I'm with people I don't trust at night."</p><p>" Will you believe me if I put it there Right on the counterpane-that I do trust you?"</p><p>" You'd say so, Mister Man.-I'm a collector. My ninety isn't mine-you won't think that. I pick it up a dollar at a time All round the country for the Weekly News, Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News?"</p><p>" Known it since I was young."</p><p>" Then you know me. Now we are getting on together-talking. I'm sort of Something for it at the front. My business is to find what people want: They pay for it, and so they ought to have it. Fairbanks, he says to me-he's editor- Feel out the public sentiment-he says. A good deal comes on me when all is said. The only trouble is we disagree In politics: I'm Vermont Democrat- You know what that is, sort of double-dyed; The News has always been Republican. Fairbanks, he says to me, ' Help us this year,' Meaning by us their ticket. ' No,' I says, 'I can't and won't. You've been in long enough:</p><p>It's time you turned around and boosted us. You'll have to pay me more than ten a week If I'm expected to elect Bill Taft. I doubt if I could do it anyway.' "</p><p>" You seem to shape the paper's policy."</p><p>" You see I'm in with everybody, know 'em all. I almost know their farms as well as they do."</p><p>"You drive around? It must be pleasant work."</p><p>"It's business, but I can't say it's not fun. What I like best's the lay of different farms, Coming out on them from a stretch of woods, Or over a hill or round a sudden corner. I like to find folks getting out in spring, Raking the dooryard, working near the house.</p><p>Later they get out further in the fields. Everything's shut sometimes except the barn; The family's all away in some back meadow. There's a hay load a-coming-when it comes. And later still they all get driven in: The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches</p><p>Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees To whips and poles. There's nobody about. The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking.</p><p>And I lie back and ride. I take the reins Only when someone's coming, and the mare Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go. I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one. She's got so she turns in at every house</p><p>As if she had some sort of curvature, No matter if I have no errand there. She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am. It's seldom I get down except for meals, though.</p><p>Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, All in a family row down to the youngest."</p><p>" One would suppose they might not be as glad To see you as you are to see them."</p><p>" Oh,</p><p>Because I want their dollar. I don't want Anything they've not got. I never dun. I'm there, and they can pay me if they like. I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by. Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink. I drink out of the bottle-not your style. Mayn't I offer you-? "</p><p>" No, no, no, thank you."</p><p>"Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.-</p><p>And now I'm leaving you a little while. You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps- Lie down-let yourself go and get some sleep. But first-let's see-what was I going to ask you?</p><p>Those collars-who shall I address them to, Suppose you aren't awake when I come back ? "</p><p>" Really, friend, I can't let you. You-may need them."</p><p>"Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style."</p><p>" But really I-I have so many collars."</p><p>" I don't know who I rather would have have them.</p><p>They're only turning yellow where they are. But you're the doctor as the saying is. I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me: I've just begun the night. You get some sleep. I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door When I come back so you'll know who it is. There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people.</p><p>I don't want you should shoot me in the head. What am I doing carrying off this bottle? There now, you get some sleep."</p><p>He shut the door. The Doctor slid a little down the pillow.</p></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><p>&nbsp</p><p>Continue to:</p><ul><li>prev: <a href="The-Mountain.html">The Mountain</a></li><li><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></li><li>next: <a href="Home-Burial.html">Home Burial</a></li></ul><h1>Tags</h1><p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=Boston">Boston</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bookdome.com/search.html?cx=008998453558275895219%3Ararbqdcnz6s&cof=FORID%3A10&sa=Search&q=poems">poems</a></p><!-- SwishCommand noindex --></div><br><!-- content end --><br /><!-- AddThis Button BEGIN --><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_2"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_3"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_4"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a><a class="addthis_counter addthis_bubble_style"></a></div><script type="text/javascript">var addthis_config = {"data_track_addressbar":true};</script><script type="text/javascript" src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-538af58830863a24"></script><!-- AddThis Button END --><br /><div class="hidden-phone"><br /><script type="text/javascript"><!--
