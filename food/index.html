Schumacher</a></dt><dd>This little work is written for the progressive element in the hotel and restaurant profession because of the fact that the menus and bills of fare are, to a great extent, neither intelligible to the server nor the served. Therefore, a method of naming dishes will be offered in the following pages, which I hope will be satisfactory to all concerned — proprietors, employees and guests.

In the present work, which contains all the important elements and first principles of Cookery necessary to be learnt, in order to render ordinary works on the subject intelligible, the attempt has been made to so mingle recipes with anecdote, that the perusal of the book may be a means of entertainment as well as of useful information. The work is intended more for the drawing-room than for the kitchen, for the Author believes that, among the great mass of the middle classes in this country—the class that is suffering most from the incapacity of domestic servants—the remedy lies with themselves

Our thanks are due to all those kind friends who, by furnishing formulas for cooking, or by giving advertisements, have contributed to the success of the undertaking. We trust that all who may purchase this volume will find it a real household treasure, for "civilized man cannot live without cooks, and those who cook must have good rules to rely upon, in order to prepare wholesome and delicious meals.

Murrey</a></dt><dd>This little handbook is offered to housekeepers, in order that they may readily understand the popular dietetic formulas so universally recommended by physicians, many of whom neglect the details of preparing the nutriment they prescribe, owing probably to the fact that all physicians are not cooks, as many of them were in olden, and all of them should be in modern, times.

A few of the ingredients and cooking utensils used in this book may not be obtainable everywhere. The distributor of the book will be glad to furnish information to any inquiries about where they may be purchased.

The number of receipts has been purposely limited, in order that no one may have the least difficulty in finding and choosing a dish, and that there may yet be a sufficient variety to please the most capricious taste.

If some of the ingredients mentioned in this book are not available outside Bengal or outside India, the preparations requiring them may be dropped altogether and if they are of little importance the preparations may be tried without them. This will not hamper one in his attempt to learn the art of Indian cooking as such ingredients and the preparations requiring them form a very small minority. Nearly all' the ingredients mentioned here are produced in nearly all parts of the world or are imported by them.

There is a convenient pocket in the back cover of the book in which the recipes can be put while they are waiting to be pasted on the blank pages which follow each section of the book. So that some day, when you feel inclined, you can sort out all these precious bits of gastronomic lore and paste them in where they belong. You thus have a cookery book which, in a sense, is as much yours as it is mine, for although I am responsible for 121 recipes, eighty-six pages of the book will be filled by recipes of your own choice.

Now these do exist in the great centres from New York to California, and even perfect cooking can be found in places remote from capital towns, in Louisiana, Maryland, and Long Island, because of the tradition having been kept alive through gene-rations. But, alas, " messy " cooking has of late years crept in to an alarming extent, and it is against this that I am warning you; hence, I feel justified in presenting to you an extreme view of the existing state of things, a caricature, perhaps, but still true enough as regards the great majority of Anglo-Saxon feeders.

Time-saving cookery has another use. In every home, no matter how well it is run, emergencies arise necessitating a quick change of menu. Perhaps one's husband brings home an unexpected guest, or at the busiest time of the morning a neighbor drops in "for a minute" and stays an hour, or small son is sent home ill from school and must be put to bed and dosed. At such moments as these, quick catering is thrice blessed.
