We have aimed to present this digest in the light of the entire biological and clinical literature on the subject, hoping that it may encourage more intensive work on hunger and appetite control, particularly in the fields of clinical medicine and comparative physiology, as the work of the past on this problem is not commensurate with its biological, medical, and economic importance.

Mayo Robson</a></dt><dd>It would seem hardly necessary to find any excuse for the publication of a monograph on cancer of the stomach and its treatment, for when it is realised how frequent gastric cancer is and that the disease is at first local and curable in a considerable proportion of cases by early removal; the stomach being in fact invaded more frequently than any other organ accessible to direct observation, it is curious that surgical treatment of this disease has not yet received more attention.

They have been corrected from the shorthand writer's notes, and are published in almost exactly the form in which they were given.
The Sanitary apparatus described can be studied at the Parkes Museum of Hygiene in University College, London.

Kashalikar</a></dt><dd>Besides the arbitrary divisions of medicine, fields other than medicine such as education, agriculture, horticulture, industries and environment have bearing on the well being of an individual and the mankind Hence the education, research and practice in these fields have also to be reoriented, coordinated and integrated so as to facilitate TOTAL STRESS MANAGEMENT. This book is an attempt to provide intellectual framework for pursuing this goal. I have called this framework "Holistic Medicine" so as to distinguish it from every possible arbitrary division, branch or system of medicine with sectarian approach.

The genius of Hughlings Jackson, which has now begun to inspire English neurologists, foresaw that the dream was the key of approach to many problems of psychiatry. In the following pages I have attempted to present, as simply as possible, a view of dreams that is not purely deterministic. Interpretation must necessarily be a personal matter, and therefore I cannot claim that all the views expressed in this book would be supported by the Swiss school.

For the purpose of effecting these desirable objects, I have endeavored to simplify as much as possible the anatomical details, and to bring together such material facts in relation to the operations upon the principal arteries of the body, as may lead to correct conclusions relative to the treatment of the various accidents and diseases to which these vessels are exposed.

In this book I have ventured to wander in some degree from the well-trodden road and to lead the reader by other ways to the comprehension of his subject.

E. Carrington</a></dt><dd>It has not been found possible in the arrangement of these dissections to classify them under the usual headings of Head and Neck, Upper extremity, Abdomen, and Lower extremity, because many of them would have been included under two or even more of these: in fact, they have often been specially planned with this object, so as to include the border lines of parts which, as they belong strictly neither to one nor the other dissector, are often neglected entirely. Nevertheless, this order has been followed for the most part, and in cases where a dissection involves partly one part and partly another, it has as far as possible been used as an intermediate link between the two.

The book is unsuited to those who have not previously rendered themselves well versed in elementary Osteology by the careful examination of the different bones, and by the attentive perusal of some of those excellent systems of Anatomy

Newell Martin</a></dt><dd>The Physiology and Hygiene of this text-book are, in general, identical with that of the " Briefer Course" edition of the "Human Body" published in the "American Science Series." In the present edition the chemical phraseology has been simplified in consequence of the requests of some teachers. A chapter has been added on the subjects of Fermentation and Distillation. The description of the effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics on the human system has been amplified, and separated into sections appended to various chapters, instead of being collected in a chapter by itself as in the "Briefer Course" edition. These changes bring the book into harmony with the laws requiring the facts concerning these substances to be taught in public schools.

Knowing anatomy and physiology is of little value to our young folks unless it helps them to practice intelligently in their daily lives the teachings of hygiene and sanitation.

In doing this, the author has kept constantly in view the desire of the Publishers to supply the information required for the Advanced Course of the Directory of the Science and Art Department; and at the same time has sought to furnish to the junior student of medicine a compendium of physiology which may assist him in obtaining a clear idea of the principles of the science, and prepare him for the perusal of works of more elaborate character.
